Project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This repo contains the necessary information for the Course Project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera
Signature Track Course.

There is an R script, run_analysis.R, a Codebook, and the list of URL's where the data sets can be found.

I put a copy of the data sets on my own server.
The training files are:
